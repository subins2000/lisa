## Reviews

#### Elegant - Windows Alternative

```
A simply Elegant and minimalistic OS straight out of China. Its a perfect Switch over for users to 
"CrossOver" to Linux as they package a premium Windows compatibility layer called "CrossOver".
Although some rumours suggest, chances of data leak is possible.
